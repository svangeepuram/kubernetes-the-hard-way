Vagrant is currently configured to create VirtualBox synced folders with
the `SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate` option enabled. If the Vagrant
guest is not trusted, you may want to disable this option. For more
information on this option, please refer to the VirtualBox manual:

  https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders

This option can be disabled globally with an environment variable:

  VAGRANT_DISABLE_VBOXSYMLINKCREATE=1

or on a per folder basis within the Vagrantfile:

  config.vm.synced_folder '/host/path', '/guest/path', SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate: false

    worker-2: If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
    worker-2: adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:
    worker-2: 
    worker-2:   sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
    worker-2: 
    worker-2: Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!
    worker-2: 
    worker-2: WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
    worker-2:          containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
    worker-2:          docker host.
    worker-2:          Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
